# Sequence and Series

-   **Sequence**
    -   An ordered list of elements
    -   Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and -1, 1, -1, 1, -1...
    -   Can be finite or infinite
-   **Series**
    -   The sum of the terms in a sequence
    -   Examples: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 and 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 0
    -   Can be finite or infinite
-   **Arithmetic Sequence**
    -   A sequence in which each term is obtained by adding a constant value to the previous term
    -   Examples: 1, 3, 5, 7... and -3, -1, 1, 3...
    -   General term: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
    -   Sum of n terms: $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$
-   **Geometric Sequence**
    -   A sequence in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant value
    -   Examples: 1, 2, 4, 8... and -3, 6, -12, 24...
    -   General term: $a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}$
    -   Sum of n terms:
        -   $S_n = \frac{a_1(r^n-1)}{r-1}$ if $r \neq 1$
        -   $S_n = na_1$ if $r = 1$
-   **Harmonic Series**
    -   A series in which the terms are reciprocals of positive integers
    -   Example: $1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ...$
    -   Diverges to infinity
-   **Convergence and Divergence**
    -   A series is said to converge if its sum approaches a finite value as the number of terms increases
    -   A series is said to diverge if its sum does not approach a finite value as the number of terms increases
-   **Tests for Convergence and Divergence**
    -   Comparison test
    -   Limit comparison test
    -   Ratio test
    -   Root test
    -   Integral test
